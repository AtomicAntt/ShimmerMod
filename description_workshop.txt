Introducing a mod that expands the Shimmer/Aether mini-biome!

The Shimmer expansion generates directly under the Shimmer, allowing entry only to players that dive into it!

Inside this new environment, you will find yourself at a new biome containing more Shimmer, 2 additional block types, and chests containing useful loot.

Taking advantage of the properties of Shimmer, players may traverse by simply submerging themselves into the Shimmer to go through solid tiles.

However, the effects of Shimmering may make it too difficult to traverse, which gives the Chromatic Cloak, obtainable by submerging a Star Cloak in the Shimmer, a great purpose! This is the cloak that allows players to be immune from Shimmer Phasing, and only allow phasing through the Shimmer when they hold down.

More Shimmer! Details
===========================================

During world generation with this mod enabled, "Expanding the shimmer" will create an additional shimmer biome underneath the biome, which will stay ~200 tiles above the underworld.

There will be two types of blocks generated. The first is an unbreakable void block which prevents players from entering the expanded Shimmer/Aether biome. To enter this expanded biome, you must submerge yourself into the vanilla-generated large pool of Shimmer.

Additionally, there will be breakable void blocks within the expanded biome, which will be somewhat tough to break, to encourage traversal through the Shimmer as players can phase through solid blocks.

Aetherium Blocks will also spawn around the biome, giving players a bigger supply if they wish to build with Aetherium Bricks/Walls/Blocks.

Warning: World generation may be buggy/disappointing in small worlds, so I recommend using this mod with medium/large worlds!
