The More Shimmer Mod! is a mod that creates an expansion of Shimmer/Aether biome under the vanilla generated Shimmer pool in the Aether!

To enter the biome, submerge yourself into the Shimmer and you will phase through solid blocks until you reach the expanded modded Shimmer biome!

Traverse through the biome by entering shimmer and find chests containing loot.

You may find that the Chromatic Cloak is useful, as you can become immune to the effects of Shimmer and choose to submerge and phase by holding down.

To create the Chromatic Cloak, submerge a Star Cloak in the Shimmer or find it in the expanded Shimmer Biome!
